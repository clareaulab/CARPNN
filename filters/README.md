## This directory contains BindCraft-like filters for Boltz output

The reference_BindCraft_default_filters is the original filter file from BindCraft in which the Boltz filters are all based on.

Note: The i_pae value in BindCraft is normalized (i_pae = pae_interaction / 31). We will be using the unnormalized pAE interaction as filter for consistency.
